Mobiscroll
==========

What is Mobiscroll?
-----------------
Mobiscroll is a UI library for progressive webapps and hybrid development. Created with a lot of attention to usability and performance. [Mobiscroll Forms](https://mobiscroll.com/forms) ships with 16 customizable controls that you can use for free that are included in this repository. Use Forms with the premium products that can be found on the [Mobiscroll website](https://mobiscroll.com).

Where can I use Mobiscroll?
-----------------
You can use the controls in web and hybrid/native cross-platform apps. At it's core Mobiscroll is framework agnostic, but API variants for jQuery/jQuery Mobile, Angular/Ionic, Angular JS/Ionic 1 and React is available.

Elements
-----------------

#### Single and multiline text

Text fields are the backbone of every form. Use it to capture a wide range of properties from plain text to passwords.

Use labels, icons, placeholders or a combination of them to help users get meaning at a glance. Show/hide functionality built in for password fields.

#### Select styling

Similar to the single line input styling, it features a chevron/dropdown arrow to clearly signal the difference between select and text input.

#### Buttons

Buttons with different states, styles and alignments. Inline or raised, left aligned, right aligned, centered or justified. Full-width buttons supported as well.

Use it with or without icons.

#### Segmented control

Easily lay out two to five options for single and multiple select. Making all options instantly visible lets users make selections with a single interaction instead of at least 3 (tap to open select, do the select, hit set - like for the traditional dropdown).

#### Checkbox and checklist

Similar to the native checkbox in functionality but a look and feel that fits with the overall user experience and theme. Features description text, checkbox list and disabled styling.

Excellent choice for inline multi-select lists.

#### Radio button list

Single select for a list of options. Use it instead of the segmented control if there are more items that would fit in a single line.

Usually a good choice for five options and above. Features disabled styling and optional description.

#### Switch

Just like the checkbox, the switch lets users turn options on/off. Can be rendered as a list of fields, like the checkbox list or as a stand-alone control.

Features optional description and disabled styling.

#### Stepper

When users need to make small adjustments to values by increasing or decreasing it avoid free-form input and dropdowns. Steppers help in minimizing mistakes, and reduce the number of taps for getting the values right.

#### Page and typography

Takes care of setting the background colors, spacing and typographic styling. It makes sure that the content you add shows up nicely on any screen-size.

#### Slider

Work your way from a monotone, dropdown heavy form to an easily scannable page by switching controls. Consider using sliders for selecting one or multiple values from a range.

Continuous ranges, steps, floating value display, disabled styling and usage with icons is supported out of the box.

#### Progress

Provide visual feedback to the user. Reduce anxiety and help people understand progress with the control. You can also use it as a completness meter to show how the user does on completing a purchase.

With a powerful API control the state, value programtically and restart, pause it if you need to.

#### Alert, confirm and prompt

Show alert messages, confirmation dialogs and prompt for focused value entry. Supporting platform specific look & feel, make your users feel at home and communicate what they actually need to see.

These controls cannot be dismissed by pressing the overlay, avoiding closing it by mistake.

#### Toast and snackbar

Keep your users up to date with notifications. Either in form of a toast or a snackbar.

Choose to provide an action with the message, like UNDO or RETRY, something that helps the user make progress faster towards their desired goal.
